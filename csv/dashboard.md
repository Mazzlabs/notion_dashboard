    How to Set Up Your Dashboard (3 Simple Steps)

        Import Your Data: Under each section below, use the / command to find the "Table - Full page" block. Choose the "Import" option and upload the corresponding CSV file (courses.csv, assignments.csv, etc.). This will create your core databases.

        Connect Your Databases: This is the most important step! After importing, you must connect the databases. For example, open the Assignments database, click the Course property, change its type to Relation, and select your Courses database. Do this for all relational links.

        Build Your Views: On this main page, create Linked Views of your databases to build your interactive dashboard. Use different layouts like Calendars for due dates, Boards for project status, and Galleries for resources.
