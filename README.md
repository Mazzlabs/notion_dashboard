## 1️⃣ Phase 1: Template Setup

> Note: This step runs a CLI script that calls the Notion API. You do not host a server for Phase 1—just run the script locally and check your Notion workspace for the new dashboard page.

In your terminal, navigate to the project root (where `package.json` and `create-cs-dashboard.js` live), for example:
 ```bash
 cd ~/Documents/RCC/notion
 ```

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up your environment
cp .env.example .env
# Add your NOTION_TOKEN and NOTION_PARENT_PAGE_ID

# Create the complete dashboard
node create-cs-dashboard.js
```

This creates a comprehensive system that grows with you throughout your CS education and early career!

## 2️⃣ Phase 2: Optional Link-Preview Integration

Enhance your dashboard with live link previews for coding resources by implementing a lightweight OAuth 2.0 flow and unfurl endpoint:

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /notion/authorize` — Initiate OAuth with GitHub, LeetCode, or Codecademy.
- `POST /notion/token` — Exchange authorization code for an access token.
- `POST /unfurl` — Callback to unfurl URLs in Notion and return structured preview data:
  ```json
  {
    "title": "Repo Name",
    "description": "Repository description",
    "image": "https://.../preview.png",
    "stats": { "stars": 123, "forks": 45 },
    "url": "https://github.com/..."
  }
  ```
  
These endpoints can be served from a simple Node.js server if you choose to enable live previews in your template.

**Setup & Run the Server**
```bash
# Install new dependencies
npm install
# Start the link-preview server
npm start
```

## 🚢 Deployment

### Local Testing with Ngrok
- Run the server locally: `npm start` (default port 3001).
- Expose via ngrok: `ngrok http 3001`.
- Update your Notion integration settings and OAuth redirect URI to point at `https://<YOUR_NGROK_SUBDOMAIN>.ngrok.io/notion/token`.

### Production Deployment
Deploy your link-preview server to a public host so Notion can reach your endpoints:

**Heroku**:
- Create a Heroku app: `heroku create your-app-name`
- Add a Procfile with `web: node server.js`.
- Set env vars: `heroku config:set GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=... GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=... NOTION_TOKEN=...`
- Push and deploy: `git push heroku main`.
- Update Notion integration callback URLs to `https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com/notion/token` and `/unfurl` endpoints.

**Vercel / Netlify / AWS**:
- Follow their docs to deploy a Node.js API service, set your environment variables, and point Notion’s OAuth redirect and unfurl URLs to the live domain.
